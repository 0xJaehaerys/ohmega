> **It's not an OHM fork, it's the future backbone of global finance and a massive liquidity engine built on the fastest chain in existence.**

## Overview

notanohmfork is a DeFi protocol built on MegaETH that combines OHM-style Dynamic Automated Treasury (DAT) mechanisms with innovative Reserve Bound Stability (RBS) to create a self-reinforcing liquidity engine for the MegaETH ecosystem.

### Key Features

- **Reserve-Backed Token (RBT)**: Every token backed 1.2:1 by treasury reserves
- **Upper-Bound RBS**: System only triggers on premium trading, capturing upside while reinforcing treasury strength
- **MegaETH Native**: Built specifically for the fastest blockchain with real-time performance
- **Diversified Treasury**: Basket of stable and volatile assets, with priority to MegaETH ecosystem tokens
- **Yield Generation**: Integration with Avon's megaNOTE and USDm for passive treasury growth

## How It Works

### 1. Bonding Mechanism

Users deposit assets (primarily $MEGA) to mint RBT tokens at 1.2:1 backing ratio:
- **User receives**: 1.0 RBT
- **Treasury receives**: 1.2 worth of assets
- **Extra 0.2**: Allocated to treasury for backing strength

### 2. Upper-Bound RBS (Range Bound Stability)

Unlike traditional DATs that expand supply dynamically:
- **Only activates when RBT trades at a premium** (above intrinsic value)
- **Sells additional treasury RBTs** on the market
- **Proceeds cycle back** into reserves
- **Strengthens backing** and compounds liquidity
- **No sell pressure** during consolidation phases

### 3. Treasury Composition

**Target Allocation:**
- 60% - $MEGA (MegaETH ecosystem alignment)
- 20% - megaNOTE (Avon's yield-bearing vault token)
- 10% - USDm (MegaETH native stablecoin)
- 10% - $OHM (homage to the OG, ohmies can participate)

### 4. Revenue Streams

- Appreciation of $MEGA triggering upper-bound RBS activity
- Arbitrage opportunities from deposits
- Staking rewards and ecosystem incentives
- Yield from megaNOTE vaults
- USDm reserve yield

## Why MegaETH?

MegaETH is the perfect foundation for notanohmfork:

- **Real-time Performance**: 10ms latency, 100,000 TPS
- **Sub-cent Gas Fees**: Makes active treasury management economically viable
- **Native Stablecoin (USDm)**: Yield-generating reserves
- **Sequencer Rotation**: Global decentralization
- **Proximity Markets**: Optimal execution for treasury operations
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Avon lending, native DeFi primitives

## Differentiators

### vs OlympusDAO
- ❌ No rebase mechanism
- ✅ Upper-bound only RBS (no lower bound selling)
- ✅ MegaETH-native with real-time performance
- ✅ Integration with yield-bearing collateral (megaNOTE)
- ✅ Designed for ecosystem liquidity capture, not just reserve currency

### vs Baseline/YesMoney
- ✅ Similar guaranteed backing approach
- ✅ Two-token model instead of single token
- ✅ Focus on MegaETH ecosystem growth
- ✅ Upper-bound RBS vs full-range stability
- ✅ Community-aligned from day 1

## Vision

**"Would be cool to have a project backed by a diversified basket of yield-accruing on-chain assets, built to generate sustainable yield and function as a core liquidity engine for the @megaeth ecosystem."**

notanohmfork is building exactly that - a self-reinforcing, liquidity-capturing treasury that compounds underlying assets while maintaining price discipline and sustainable onchain growth.

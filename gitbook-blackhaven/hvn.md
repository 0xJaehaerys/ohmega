# HVN

## Governance

HVN is the governance and incentive token of Blackhaven. It grants holders direct influence over key parameters and strategic direction. Governance is fully on-chain and open to all HVN holders, ensuring transparency and alignment across the ecosystem.

Governance proposals are initiated by contributors and core participants, while HVN holders vote to approve or reject these proposals. This framework ensures that decision-making remains efficient and guided by informed stakeholders, while still reflecting the collective will of the community.

Proposals may include adjustments to:

- Treasury composition, deployment strategy, and reserve parameters
- Reward distribution rates and emission schedules
- Whitelisting or removal of MegaETH DeFi strategies
- Allocation of Blackhaven's staked MEGA within the Proximity Market

Each HVN token represents one vote in governance. This structure keeps the process transparent, data-driven, and directly aligned with long-term ecosystem growth.

## Staking & Rewards (sHVN)

sHVN represents staked HVN and serves as the governance-linked token that anchors participation and reward distribution across Blackhaven.

sHVN holders earn rewards derived from treasury growth and other incentives accumulated throughout Blackhaven treasury management. Rewards will be distributed to stakers depending on the available reward pool, which will be configured after the treasury growth phase through a governance proposal.

The system is designed to reward participants who demonstrate long-term alignment with Blackhaven's growth, rather than short-term speculative capital.

## Proximity Influence (MegaETH Integration)

> MegaETH's Proximity Market allows market makers and dApps to bid for sequencer-adjacent floorspace, improving execution speed and liquidity efficiency across DeFi.

Blackhaven plans to actively participate in the MegaETH sequencer and proximity markets using the MEGA accumulated through treasury operations. This MEGA will be deployed to generate yield, contribute to network performance, and strengthen Blackhaven's position within the ecosystem. 

Through HVN governance, decisions will determine how this exposure is positioned to align with ecosystem incentives, yield opportunities, and network utility. External participants can acquire HVN to influence these decisions, directing how Blackhaven's MEGA is utilized within the proximity markets.

All actions remain transparent and verifiable onchain, ensuring Blackhaven's treasury activity supports both performance and long-term network value.

## Baseline Utilization

Blackhaven will launch HVN on Baseline Markets, a token market built around real, locked liquidity where the system—not market makers—handles price discovery and liquidity. Baseline establishes an on-chain Baseline Value (BLV) that acts as a guaranteed price floor, backed by reserves for every token. Buyers receive a protected, transparent entry from day one.

**How Baseline works for HVN**

- The BLV sets the lowest tradable price onchain and rises with trading activity and liquidity depth.
- Liquidity is autonomous and value-retentive, with no custom deals, private spreads, or silent extraction.
- Capital-efficient, liquidation-free borrowing and leverage that scales liquidity with demand, supporting deeper markets and fairer participation.

**Why this matters**

- Clear downside definition at launch
- Liquidity that cannot be pulled by third parties
- Growth tied to real market activity rather than emissions

> By combining a guaranteed price floor (BLV) with capital-efficient borrowing and non-liquidatable leverage, Baseline automatically scales liquidity to support higher prices, deeper markets, and fairer participation. [Baseline Market Docs](https://docs.baseline.markets/).

## Tokenomics

### Blackhaven Token Allocation

With a total supply of 100,000,000 tokens, the Blackhaven token distribution is designed to be a community focused benefit to the MEGA ecosystem. The allocation is structured as follows:

### Core Contributors

This 12.50% allocation is designated for Blackhaven core contributors and strategic advisors who have dedicated their efforts to the development and launch of the protocol. To align their interests with the long-term success of the project, all core contributor tokens are subject to a 1-year cliff, followed by a 2-year linear vesting schedule. No tokens are unlocked for contributors before the initial one-year period is complete.

### Private Round

The private round allocation of 7.50% represents the token rights acquired by early backers who provided foundational support for the Blackhaven protocol. These partners were instrumental in bootstrapping the project's initial development and strategy. All private round tokens are locked for a 1-year cliff, after which they vest linearly over a 3-month period.

### Public Round

To ensure we are community first and high float, 22% of the total supply was allocated to the public round. This allocation allows the wider community to take part in Blackhaven from its inception. Tokens from the public round have no vesting period and are unlocked at Token Generation Event (TGE).

### Ecosystem

An allocation of 18% is reserved for ecosystem development. These funds will be used to support initiatives that expand the Blackhaven ecosystem, including grants for developers, strategic partnerships, community-building activities, and other approved initiatives. The ecosystem tokens are subject to a 1-year linear vesting schedule to ensure a steady and sustainable distribution of resources.

### Future Emissions & Rewards

The largest portion of the supply, 40%, is allocated for future emissions and rewards. This reserve will be used to incentivize, provide liquidity rewards, and fund other programs that drive the long-term growth and utility of the Blackhaven ecosystem. These tokens have no vesting schedule and will be deployed as needed to support the health of the network.

Unlock schedules for all vested allocations will commence on the Token Generation Event (TGE) date.

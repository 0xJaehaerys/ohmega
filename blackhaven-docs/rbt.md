# RBT (BLK)

The Reserve-Backed Token (RBT) represents the underlying backing of the Blackhaven treasury and reflects the value accumulated through treasury activity, including note and bond issuance. Its value is supported by onchain reserves that evolve as the treasury expands.

Users receive RBT by depositing whitelisted assets into the Blackhaven dApp through products such as Haven Protected Notes and Bonds. As treasury inflows increase, additional RBT is issued proportionally to preserve the reserve ratio. All backing assets are held and managed by the Blackhaven treasury with full transparency and verifiable onchain accountability.

RBT provides a verifiable representation of the treasury's backing and can be utilized across the MegaETH DeFi ecosystem in various products and liquidity strategies. This allows users to engage with onchain markets while maintaining alignment with Blackhaven's treasury growth and participation in the broader MegaETH network.

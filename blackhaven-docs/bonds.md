# Fixed-Term Bonds

Blackhaven acquires assets through its bonding mechanism, offering users vested payout tokens at a discount supplemented by additional rewards. Users exchange a quote asset (USDM or MEGA) for a payout asset (RBT) that vests gradually over time. The discount makes bonding more appealing than open-market RBT purchases, while vesting discourages immediate selling. This fosters long-term alignment between Blackhaven and users, driving treasury growth. 

Aligned Bonds (LP Bonds) are used exclusively to deepen ecosystem liquidity and boost MEGA rewards inflow. All bond programs are designed to increase the reserve backing of RBT, build Protocol Owned Liquidity, and enhance MegaETH liquidity depth.

### How Aligned Bonds Work

Aligned Bonds (LP Bonds) are the core mechanism Blackhaven uses to build deep, protocol-owned liquidity (POL) for RBT, starting with the RBT-USDM pool, while aligning incentives between users and the treasury.

**Quick Steps:**

**Bonding**

1. Provide liquidity to the RBT-USDM pool and receive an LP token.

2. Select a Bond Term, along with its associated discount and Rewards

3. Deposit the LP token.

LP from bond purchases becomes Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and remains in Blackhaven's treasury permanently.

### Bond Structure and Vesting

Blackhaven bonds are fixed-term instruments that vest linearly over a user-selected period, offering flexibility to match risk tolerance and liquidity needs.

- **Maturity and Redemption**: At the end of the vesting period, users redeem their fully vested RBT amount along with any other incentives earned, boosting the value of holding to term.

- **Early Redemption**: Premature exits are possible but incur a standard fee (e.g., a principal percentage) and forfeit unvested payouts or rewards. These forfeited amounts flow to the treasury, creating a surplus that further increases RBT's backing.

### Bond Maturation

A 1-Month bond term matures 30 days after bonding, at which point your bond fully vests and becomes claimable.

### Benefits

Bonds create a self-reinforcing system:

- POL generates trading fees to fund rewards and expand liquidity.

- No sell pressure (LP remains locked forever in treasury).

- Every bond deepens RBT-USDM liquidity and strengthens RBT backing.

This aligns all participants:

- **Users:** earn discounted RBT and rewards for long-term commitment.

- **Blackhaven:** secures permanent, high-quality liquidity.

- **RBT holders:** benefit from tighter spreads, lower volatility, and rising backing.

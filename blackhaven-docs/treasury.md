# Treasury

Blackhaven's treasury securely manages user deposits, grows reserves sustainably, and channels on-chain liquidity into productive strategies across the MegaETH ecosystem. The treasury prioritizes conservative risk parameters and full transparency: all deposited capital stays fully backed and redeemable per product terms.

### **Key Sources of Treasury Inflow**

- **User Deposits**: Capital enters through Haven Protected Notes and Bonds

- **Yield**: Returns generated from deployments across MegaETH

- **Points Programs**: Accrued Mega Points from qualifying activities and deployments

- **Premium Range Mechanism:** Captures RBT price range premiums, redirecting surplus value to treasury reserves for stronger backing and stability.

### **Amplifying RBT Backing**

Treasury inflows expand the backing that supports RBT. As reserves grow, RBT supply increases in line with the reserve ratio policy. This maintains a transparent link between treasury value and circulating RBT supply.

### **DAT-Inspired Retention of MEGA**

Blackhaven introduces an innovative DAT-inspired allocation model by retaining MEGA tokens derived from Mega Points—earned through forfeits, early exit penalties, and capital allocations. This captured MEGA fuels treasury reserves and could potentially increase the backing of RBT. To foster deeper alignment with MegaETH, all the MEGA will be staked in the MegaETH Sequencer, cycling those rewards directly back into the reserves.

### **Protocol Owned Liquidity**

Inspired by OlympusDAO's pioneering model (which enables treasuries to build durable positions without relying on transient liquidity mining), Blackhaven deploys POL, sourced from LP bonds, to curb mercenary capital dependence. This fortifies RBT with deep, self-sustaining market depth, enhancing liquidity efficiency and price stability. As POL scales with treasury growth, it sparks a virtuous cycle: boosted trading activity signals robust backing, drawing fresh inflows to reserves and enabling steady RBT supply expansion

### **Self-Reinforcing Treasury Flywheel**

Treasury expansion increases RBT backing, unlocking fresh deployable capital. These assets are then allocated to generate yield and accrue points, channeling returns back to users and the treasury. This flywheel compounds reserves while scaling participant rewards in a self-reinforcing loop.

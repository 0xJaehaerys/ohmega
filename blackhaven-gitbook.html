    <h1>Blackhaven Overview</h1>
    <p>₍ᐢ. .ᐢ₎ Treasury-Powered Liquidity</p>
    <p>Blackhaven is a reserve-backed treathesury that functions as a liquidity engine, giving users optimized exposure to the MegaETH ecosystem. It operates as a self-reinforcing treasury model that incentivizes participation across all time horizons and prioritizes sustainable growth.</p>
    <p>Depositors are rewarded through value-accruing instruments such as principal-protected convertible notes and fixed-term bonds. Blackhaven deploys idle capital into whitelisted MegaETH DeFi strategies, generates rewards, redistributes value to participants, and compounds gains into a growing reserve.</p>
    <p>Simultaneously, Blackhaven perpetually expands its reserves by capturing treasury premiums from native MegaETH ecosystem assets, leveraging MegaETH's high-throughput and real-time architecture to compound and distribute value efficiently on-chain.</p>
    <p>This dual structure creates a closed-loop flywheel. User deposits fuel on-chain activity, which produces rewards for participants, while surplus value strengthens the treasury and reinforces long-term system resilience.</p>

    <h2>Core Objectives</h2>
    <p>Blackhaven is designed to achieve five core objectives that define its function within the MegaETH ecosystem:</p>

    <h1>HVN</h1>
    <h3>Governance</h3>
    <p>HVN is the governance and incentive token of Blackhaven. It grants holders direct influence over key parameters and strategic direction. Governance is fully on-chain and open to all HVN holders, ensuring transparency and alignment across the ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Governance proposals are initiated by contributors and core participants, while HVN holders vote to approve or reject these proposals. This framework ensures that decision-making remains efficient and guided by informed stakeholders, while still reflecting the collective will of the community.</p>
    <p>Proposals may include adjustments to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Treasury composition, deployment strategy, and reserve parameters</li>
        <li>Reward distribution rates and emission schedules</li>
        <li>Whitelisting or removal of MegaETH DeFi strategies</li>
        <li>Allocation of Blackhaven's staked MEGA within the Proximity Market</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each HVN token represents one vote in governance. This structure keeps the process transparent, data-driven, and directly aligned with long-term ecosystem growth.</p>
    
    <h3>Staking & Rewards (sHVN)</h3>
    <p>sHVN represents staked HVN and serves as the governance-linked token that anchors participation and reward distribution across Blackhaven.</p>
    <p>sHVN holders earn rewards derived from treasury growth and other incentives accumulated throughout Blackhaven treasury management. Rewards will be distributed to stakers depending on the available reward pool, which will be configured after the treasury growth phase through a governance proposal.</p>
    <p>The system is designed to reward participants who demonstrate long-term alignment with Blackhaven's growth, rather than short-term speculative capital.</p>
    
    <h3>Proximity Influence (MegaETH Integration)</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>MegaETH's Proximity Market allows market makers and dApps to bid for sequencer-adjacent floorspace, improving execution speed and liquidity efficiency across DeFi.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Blackhaven plans to actively participate in the MegaETH sequencer and proximity markets using the MEGA accumulated through treasury operations. This MEGA will be deployed to generate yield, contribute to network performance, and strengthen Blackhaven's position within the ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Through HVN governance, decisions will determine how this exposure is positioned to align with ecosystem incentives, yield opportunities, and network utility. External participants can acquire HVN to influence these decisions, directing how Blackhaven's MEGA is utilized within the proximity markets.</p>
    <p>All actions remain transparent and verifiable onchain, ensuring Blackhaven's treasury activity supports both performance and long-term network value.</p>
    
    <h3>Baseline Utilization</h3>
    <p>Blackhaven will launch HVN on Baseline Markets, a token market built around real, locked liquidity where the system—not market makers—handles price discovery and liquidity. Baseline establishes an on-chain Baseline Value (BLV) that acts as a guaranteed price floor, backed by reserves for every token. Buyers receive a protected, transparent entry from day one.</p>
    <p><strong>How Baseline works for HVN</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The BLV sets the lowest tradable price onchain and rises with trading activity and liquidity depth.</li>
        <li>Liquidity is autonomous and value-retentive, with no custom deals, private spreads, or silent extraction.</li>
        <li>Capital-efficient, liquidation-free borrowing and leverage that scales liquidity with demand, supporting deeper markets and fairer participation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear downside definition at launch</li>
        <li>Liquidity that cannot be pulled by third parties</li>
        <li>Growth tied to real market activity rather than emissions</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p>By combining a guaranteed price floor (BLV) with capital-efficient borrowing and non-liquidatable leverage, Baseline automatically scales liquidity to support higher prices, deeper markets, and fairer participation. <a href="https://docs.baseline.markets/">Baseline Market Docs</a>.</p>

    <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
    <p>[tokenomics.jpg]</p>
    <h3>Blackhaven Token Allocation</h3>
    <p>With a total supply of 100,000,000 tokens, the Blackhaven token distribution is designed to be a community focused benefit to the MEGA ecosystem. The allocation is structured as follows:</p>
    
    <h3>Core Contributors</h3>
    <p>This 12.50% allocation is designated for Blackhaven core contributors and strategic advisors who have dedicated their efforts to the development and launch of the protocol. To align their interests with the long-term success of the project, all core contributor tokens are subject to a 1-year cliff, followed by a 2-year linear vesting schedule. No tokens are unlocked for contributors before the initial one-year period is complete.</p>
    
    <h3>Private Round</h3>
    <p>The private round allocation of 7.50% represents the token rights acquired by early backers who provided foundational support for the Blackhaven protocol. These partners were instrumental in bootstrapping the project's initial development and strategy. All private round tokens are locked for a 1-year cliff, after which they vest linearly over a 3-month period.</p>
    
    <h3>Public Round</h3>
    <p>To ensure we are community first and high float, 22% of the total supply was allocated to the public round. This allocation allows the wider community to take part in Blackhaven from its inception. Tokens from the public round have no vesting period and are unlocked at Token Generation Event (TGE).</p>
    
    <h3>Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>An allocation of 18% is reserved for ecosystem development. These funds will be used to support initiatives that expand the Blackhaven ecosystem, including grants for developers, strategic partnerships, community-building activities, and other approved initiatives. The ecosystem tokens are subject to a 1-year linear vesting schedule to ensure a steady and sustainable distribution of resources.</p>
    
    <h3>Future Emissions & Rewards</h3>
    <p>The largest portion of the supply, 40%, is allocated for future emissions and rewards. This reserve will be used to incentivize, provide liquidity rewards, and fund other programs that drive the long-term growth and utility of the Blackhaven ecosystem. These tokens have no vesting schedule and will be deployed as needed to support the health of the network.</p>
    <p>Unlock schedules for all vested allocations will commence on the Token Generation Event (TGE) date.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h1>RBT (BLK)</h1>
    <p>The Reserve-Backed Token (RBT) represents the underlying backing of the Blackhaven treasury and reflects the value accumulated through treasury activity, including note and bond issuance. Its value is supported by onchain reserves that evolve as the treasury expands.</p>
    <p>Users receive RBT by depositing whitelisted assets into the Blackhaven dApp through products such as Haven Protected Notes and Bonds. As treasury inflows increase, additional RBT is issued proportionally to preserve the reserve ratio. All backing assets are held and managed by the Blackhaven treasury with full transparency and verifiable onchain accountability.</p>
    <p>RBT provides a verifiable representation of the treasury's backing and can be utilized across the MegaETH DeFi ecosystem in various products and liquidity strategies. This allows users to engage with onchain markets while maintaining alignment with Blackhaven's treasury growth and participation in the broader MegaETH network.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h1>Treasury</h1>
    <p>Blackhaven's treasury securely manages user deposits, grows reserves sustainably, and channels on-chain liquidity into productive strategies across the MegaETH ecosystem. The treasury prioritizes conservative risk parameters and full transparency: all deposited capital stays fully backed and redeemable per product terms.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Sources of Treasury Inflow</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Deposits</strong>: Capital enters through Haven Protected Notes and Bonds</li>
        <li><strong>Yield</strong>: Returns generated from deployments across MegaETH</li>
        <li><strong>Points Programs</strong>: Accrued Mega Points from qualifying activities and deployments</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Range Mechanism:</strong> Captures RBT price range premiums, redirecting surplus value to treasury reserves for stronger backing and stability.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Amplifying RBT Backing</h3>
    <p>Treasury inflows expand the backing that supports RBT. As reserves grow, RBT supply increases in line with the reserve ratio policy. This maintains a transparent link between treasury value and circulating RBT supply.</p>
    
    <h3>DAT-Inspired Retention of MEGA</h3>
    <p>Blackhaven introduces an innovative DAT-inspired allocation model by retaining MEGA tokens derived from Mega Points—earned through forfeits, early exit penalties, and capital allocations. This captured MEGA fuels treasury reserves and could potentially increase the backing of RBT. To foster deeper alignment with MegaETH, all the MEGA will be staked in the MegaETH Sequencer, cycling those rewards directly back into the reserves.</p>
    
    <h3>Protocol Owned Liquidity</h3>
    <p>Inspired by OlympusDAO's pioneering model (which enables treasuries to build durable positions without relying on transient liquidity mining), Blackhaven deploys POL, sourced from LP bonds, to curb mercenary capital dependence. This fortifies RBT with deep, self-sustaining market depth, enhancing liquidity efficiency and price stability. As POL scales with treasury growth, it sparks a virtuous cycle: boosted trading activity signals robust backing, drawing fresh inflows to reserves and enabling steady RBT supply expansion</p>
    
    <h3>Self-Reinforcing Treasury Flywheel</h3>
    <p>Treasury expansion increases RBT backing, unlocking fresh deployable capital. These assets are then allocated to generate yield and accrue points, channeling returns back to users and the treasury. This flywheel compounds reserves while scaling participant rewards in a self-reinforcing loop.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h1>Haven Protected Notes (HPN)</h1>
    <p>Haven Protected Notes (HPNs) are principal-protected positions issued as ERC-721 NFTs, designed to accrue yields and MegaETH ecosystem rewards. Users deposit stable assets (USDM or USDMy) for a chosen commitment term, minting a unique NFT that records the principal amount, terms, and ongoing rewards. Principal is fully redeemable at maturity with no market exposure, and holders can redeem RBT directly against the HPN or exit early to recover initial principal (subject to a small fee and forfeiture of unvested accruals).</p>
    <p>Blackhaven's user-first model ensures clear principal redemption while deploying deposits across vetted strategies to generate yields and earn rewards. These returns are allocated directly to depositors (with amplified MEGA Points via TVL contributions unavailable outside of Blackhaven) and reserves.</p>

    <p>💡 Haven Protected Notes are not market-priced instruments. Their value is defined solely by the principal, accrued rewards, and commitment terms, ensuring a predictable and protected user experience.</p>
    
    <h3>How HPNs Work: User Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hold to Maturity</strong><br>
        Hold the HPN through its term. The position accrues yield and MEGA points. At maturity, redeem full principal plus accrued rewards.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Early Redemption</strong><br>
        Exit at any time and recover full initial principal minus a small fee. Accrued yield and MEGA points are forfeited to the treasury.</li>
        
        <li><strong>RBT Redemption</strong><br>
        Redeem the HPN for RBT equal to the initial principal; the HPN burns on redemption and accrued yield and MEGA points are forfeited to the treasury.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>[Flowchart.jpg]</p>
    
    <p>💡 At maturity or early exit, the HPN enters a 7-day cooldown, after which the position becomes claimable.</p>

    <h1>Fixed-Term Bonds</h1>
    <p>Blackhaven acquires assets through its bonding mechanism, offering users vested payout tokens at a discount supplemented by additional rewards. Users exchange a quote asset (USDM or MEGA) for a payout asset (RBT) that vests gradually over time. The discount makes bonding more appealing than open-market RBT purchases, while vesting discourages immediate selling. This fosters long-term alignment between Blackhaven and users, driving treasury growth.</p>
    <p>Aligned Bonds (LP Bonds) are used exclusively to deepen ecosystem liquidity and boost MEGA rewards inflow. All bond programs are designed to increase the reserve backing of RBT, build Protocol Owned Liquidity, and enhance MegaETH liquidity depth.</p>
    
    <h3>How Aligned Bonds Work</h3>
    <p>Aligned Bonds (LP Bonds) are the core mechanism Blackhaven uses to build deep, protocol-owned liquidity (POL) for RBT, starting with the RBT-USDM pool, while aligning incentives between users and the treasury.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Quick Steps:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Bonding</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Provide liquidity to the RBT-USDM pool and receive an LP token.</li>
        <li>Select a Bond Term, along with its associated discount and Rewards</li>
        <li>Deposit the LP token.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>💡 LP from bond purchases becomes Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and remains in Blackhaven's treasury permanently.</p>
    
    <h3>Bond Structure and Vesting</h3>
    <p>Blackhaven bonds are fixed-term instruments that vest linearly over a user-selected period, offering flexibility to match risk tolerance and liquidity needs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maturity and Redemption</strong>: At the end of the vesting period, users redeem their fully vested RBT amount along with any other incentives earned, boosting the value of holding to term.</li>
        <li><strong>Early Redemption</strong>: Premature exits are possible but incur a standard fee (e.g., a principal percentage) and forfeit unvested payouts or rewards. These forfeited amounts flow to the treasury, creating a surplus that further increases RBT's backing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>💡 <strong>Bond Maturation</strong><br>
    A 1-Month bond term matures 30 days after bonding, at which point your bond fully vests and becomes claimable.</p>
    
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Bonds create a self-reinforcing system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>POL generates trading fees to fund rewards and expand liquidity.</li>
        <li>No sell pressure (LP remains locked forever in treasury).</li>
        <li>Every bond deepens RBT-USDM liquidity and strengthens RBT backing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This aligns all participants:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Users:</strong> earn discounted RBT and rewards for long-term commitment.</li>
        <li><strong>Blackhaven:</strong> secures permanent, high-quality liquidity.</li>
        <li><strong>RBT holders:</strong> benefit from tighter spreads, lower volatility, and rising backing.</li>
    </ul>

## Simple Explanation

**BLV (Baseline Value) = Your Safety Net**

- **What it is**: A guaranteed minimum price for HVN that can NEVER go down
- **How it works**: The more people trade HVN, the higher BLV goes
- **Why it matters**: Even if the market crashes, you're protected at BLV level
- **Bonus**: You can borrow money using HVN as collateral, up to BLV value, and NEVER get liquidated

**Think of it like**: A house with a guaranteed minimum value. Even if the market crashes, you know your house is worth at least BLV amount. And you can borrow against that guaranteed value safely.
